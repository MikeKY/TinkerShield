# TinkerShield
Prototyping Shield for Arduino Uno R3

# Purpose:
  To advance a local Maker Community CNC project -- Fabricate & Code a board "from scratch".

# Goals:
#  0)  Timeline:
       Start date Saturday 05 May 2018.  Working prototype & all development files published by Saturday 02 June 2018.
#  1)  Hardware:
       General-purpose prototyping shield (Switches, LEDs, Piezo), that also includes 1 Rotary Encoder (with integral p-button).
       KiCad (Schematic), Gerber(Path), Excellon (PTH), & G-code (CNC) files to be provided.
#  2)  Software:
       Develop accurate, low-latency debounce for switches & encoder without relying upon HW interrupts.
#  3)  Personal:
       Get from Absolute Neophyte to Newb level with regard to GitHub & Open Source Software & Hardware sharing.
